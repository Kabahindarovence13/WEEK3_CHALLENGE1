#array sorting
 -we have an array called arr1 which takes in numbers and integers
 -i then created an empty array which i assigned to a variable obj so that it can hold then values at the end of the loops
 -I put a for loop which compares with the array length and the if the value[i] modulus 2 equals 0 ,then obj[i] equals evens.
 if the value[i] modulus 2 equals 1,the obj[i] equals odds or else it prints chars.
 -The values are the pushed to the array which is being held by the obj variable.
